I'm Zhang Yu(张裕), a SET(Software Engineer for Testing) of NSB(Nokia Shanghai Bell).

I have some experiences on `Test Automation`, `Continuous Integration` and `Continuous Delivery`.

`Python` is my preferred language, I also love `NodeJS` and `data mining and virtualization`.
I use `VIM` to write everything, and I'm a fans of `Amazon Kindle`.
