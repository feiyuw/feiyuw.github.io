As we know, "static analysis" is valuable and important in developing work. Many geneous tools like `lint`, `klocwork`, `pyflakes` and `jshint` help the developer to find the problems earlier.

`Test Automation` is another style of developing work, but unfortunately we always ignore its quality. The result is, in most scenarios, the Test Automation asserts are hard to maintained and unefficiency.

I wrote a simple static analysis script for [RobotFramework](http://robotframework.org/) during the Sprint Festival, tried to add the lost part of `Test Automation`. In this blog, I want to discuss how I think and implement.

[TODO]...
